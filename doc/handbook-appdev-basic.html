<h1>The MikeOS BASIC App Developer Handbook</h1>

<h3>Version 4.1, 17 January 2010 - (C) MikeOS Developers</h3>

<p>This documentation file explains how to write software for MikeOS using the BASIC interpreter
built into the operating system. If you have any questions, see <a href="http://mikeos.berlios.de">the MikeOS website</a>
for contact details and mailing list information.</p>

<p>Click the links on the left to navigate around this guide.</p>

<br />


<hr noshade="noshade" />


<h2>Overview</h2>

<a name="features"></a>
<h3>Features</h3>

<p>The MikeOS BASIC interpreter runs a simple dialect of the BASIC programming language. There
are commands for taking input, handling the screen, performing nested loops, loading/saving files,
and so forth. You will find a full list of the included instructions later in this document. Here
are the essentials you need to know.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Numeric variables</strong> -- These are <strong>A</strong> to <strong>Z</strong>, each storing
one positive integer word (ie 0 to 65535). The <strong>R</strong> and <strong>S</strong> variables have
special roles with <strong>LOAD</strong> and <strong>SAVE</strong> commands, as explained in the instruction
list below.</li>
<li><strong>String variables</strong> -- These are <strong>$1</strong> to <strong>$8</strong>, each 128 bytes
long.</li>
<li><strong>Arrays</strong> -- You can use string variables as arrays via the <strong>PEEK</strong> and <strong>POKE</strong> commands.
For instance, <strong>X = &amp; $1</strong> places the memory location of the $1 string variable into X. You can then put data into it with eg <strong>POKE 77 X</strong> (put 77 into the memory location pointed to by X).</li>
<li><strong>Labels</strong> -- Such as <strong>box_loop:</strong> etc. Used by <strong>GOTO</strong> and <strong>GOSUB</strong>, they must have a trailing colon and be at the start of a line.</li>
<li><strong>Ending</strong> -- Programs must finish with an <strong>END</strong> statement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GOSUB</strong> calls can be nested up to ten times. <strong>FOR</strong> loops can be nested using different variables (eg you
can have a <strong>FOR X = 1 TO 10 ... NEXT X</strong> loop surrounding a <strong>FOR Y = 30 TO 50</strong> loop). You can enter code in uppercase or lowercase -- the interpreter doesn't mind either way. However, labels are case-sensitive.</p>



<br />


<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here's a small example program demonstrating various common features:</p>

<pre>rem *** MikeOS BASIC example program ***

alert "Welcome to the example!"
cls

print "Let's skip the next 'print' line..."
goto jump

print "This line will never be printed :-("

jump:
print "Righto, now enter a number:"
input x

if x &gt; 10 then print "X is bigger than 10! Wow!"
if x &lt; 10 then print "X is quite small actually."
if x = 10 then gosub equalsroutine

a = 7
b = a / 2
print "Variable A is seven here. Divided by two you get:"
print b
print "And the remainder of that is:"
b = a % 2
print b

print "A quick loop here..."
for c = 1 to 10
  print c
next c

print "Righto, that's the end! Bye!"
end

equalsroutine:
  print "Awesome, a perfect 10! Give me your name so I can high-five you!"
  input $1
  print "Top work, " ;
  print $1
return
</pre>


<p>This example should be mostly self-explanatory. You can see that the subroutine is indented with spaces,
but that's not necessary if you don't want it. You can follow <strong>IF ... THEN</strong> with any other
instruction. Regarding this part:</p>

<pre>
  print "Top work, " ;
  print $1
</pre>

<p>The space and semi-colon character (;) after the quoted string tells the interpreter not to print a newline
after the string. So here, we print the user's name on the same line. You can do this with numerical variables
as well, eg <strong>PRINT X ;</strong> etc.</p>

<p>See the Samples section at the end for more demonstration programs.</p>



<br />


<a name="assignment"></a>
<h3>Assignment</h3>


<p>The following are valid ways to assign numeric variables in MikeOS BASIC:</p>

<pre>
a = 10
a = b
a = b + 10
a = b + c
a = b - 10
a = b - c
a = b * 10
a = b * c
a = b / 10
a = b / c
a = b % 10
a = b % c
</pre>

<p>So you can use combinations of numbers and variables. Note that you can perform multiple
operations in the same line:</p>

<pre>a = b + c * 2 / 3</pre>

<p>But note that there is no operator precedence; the calculation is simply worked out one step
at a time from left to right. For string variables:</p>

<pre>
$1 = "Hello"
$1 = $2
</pre>

<p>You can get the location of a string variable to use as an array:</p>

<pre>
x = &amp; $3
</pre>

<p>You can get variables from the user with <strong>INPUT</strong> like this:</p>

<pre>
input x
input $1
</pre>



<br />


<a name="memory"></a>
<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>MikeOS and its programs exist in a single 64K memory segment. The first
32K is occupied by the kernel and disk cache. Your BASIC program may be loaded at the start of the second 32K,
ie 32768, if it is run directly from the program menu or CLI. However, if it is run from a standalone program
such as the EDIT.BIN editor, its starting point will be elsewhere. Use <strong>PROGSTART</strong> and
<strong>RAMSTART</strong> to find out what memory you can use:</p>

<pre>
x = PROGSTART
</pre>

<p>This assigns to the X variable the location at which the BASIC program was loaded. In other words, this is where
the execution of the BASIC program by the interpreter starts. We also have:</p>

<pre>
x = RAMSTART
</pre>

<p>This is one byte on from the end of the BASIC code. Therefore this is empty memory which you can use, up until the 65536 mark.
You can LOAD and SAVE files in here, PEEK and POKE around, and do what you want without it impacting the operating system or BASIC program.</p>




<br />


<a name="theeditor"></a>
<h3>The editor</h3>

<p>You can run your .BAS programs by selecting them from the program menu or typing them into the
command line interface -- eg entering <strong>example</strong> will run <strong>EXAMPLE.BAS</strong>.
Use the MikeOS file manager, <strong>FILEMAN.BIN</strong>, to make backup copies of your work and
delete old files.</p>

<p>MikeOS includes a text editor, <strong>EDIT.BIN</strong> Which you can use to edit your BASIC programs.
It lets you run your code straight from inside the editor by pressing the <strong>F8</strong> key. Note
that if your program has an infinite loop or major bug, it may hang execution -- so it's worth hitting
<strong>F2</strong> before running your code to save it to the disk. Hit <strong>F5</strong> to delete whole
lines quickly, and <strong>Esc</strong> to exit (you'll see a reminder of these keybindings in the bottom
bar of the editor).</p>

<p>The MikeOS text editor only handles Unix-style text files, and curently does not support horizontal scrolling
of lines, so keep them less than 80 chars! You can use the Delete and Backspace keys to erase characters,
but note that only Delete can be used to remove newlines.</p>


<br />

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<a name="instructions"></a>


<a name="alert"></a>
<h3>ALERT</h3>
<p>Show a dialog box on the screen with a string, and an OK button triggered by the Enter key. Example:</p>

<pre>
alert "File saved correctly."
</pre>



<br />

<a name="call"></a>
<h3>CALL</h3>
<p>Moves machine code execution to the specified point in RAM (using the x86 <strong>call</strong> instruction). The code
must be terminated with a <strong>ret</strong> (C3 hex, 195 decimal) instruction. In this example, we simply
add a <strong>ret</strong> instruction into RAM location 40000 and call it, which returns control straight back to the BASIC
interpreter:</p>
<a name="theeditor"></a>

<pre>
poke 195 40000
call 40000
</pre>



<br />

<a name="cls"></a>
<h3>CLS</h3>
<p>Clears the screen and returns the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen. Example:</p>

<pre>
cls
</pre>




<br />

<a name="cursor"></a>
<h3>CURSOR</h3>
<p>Determines whether to show the text cursor or not. Example:</p>

<pre>
cursor off
print "The cursor is off for five seconds!"
pause 50
cursor on
print "And now it's back on."
</pre>




<br />

<a name="curschar"></a>
<h3>CURSCHAR</h3>
<p>Stores the character underneath the cursor location into the specified variable. Example:</p>

<pre>
move 0 0
print "Hello world"

move 0 0
curschar x

rem *** The next command will print 'H' ***
print chr x

move 1 0
curschar x

rem *** The next command will print 'e' ***
print chr x
</pre>




<br />

<a name="end"></a>
<h3>END</h3>
<p>Terminates execution of the BASIC program and hands control back to the operating system. Example:</p>

<pre>
end
</pre>




<br />

<a name="for"></a>
<h3>FOR</h3>
<p>Begins a loop, counting upwards using a variable. The loop must be finished with a NEXT instruction
and the relevant variable. Example:</p>

<pre>
for x = 1 to 10
  print "In a loop! X is " ;
  print x
next x
</pre>




<br />

<a name="getkey"></a>
<h3>GETKEY</h3>
<p>Checks the keyboard buffer for a key, and if one has been pressed, places it into the
specified variable.</p>

<pre>
loop:
  print "Infinite loop until m or Esc is pressed..." ;
  getkey x
  if x = 'm' then goto done
  goto loop

done:
  print "Finished loop!"
</pre>




<br />

<a name="gosub"></a>
<h3>GOSUB</h3>
<p>Takes a label. It executes a subroutine, which must be finished with a RETURN instruction. You can
nest GOSUB routines up to 10 times. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "About to go into a subroutine..."
gosub mylabel
print "Subroutine done!"
end

mylabel:
  print "Inside a GOSUB here!"
return
</pre>




<br />

<a name="goto"></a>
<h3>GOTO</h3>
<p>Takes a label, and jumps to that label in the code. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "Going to miss the next 'PRINT' line of code..."
goto skippy

print "This'll never be printed."

skippy:
print "And now we're back home"
</pre>




<br />

<a name="if"></a>
<h3>IF</h3>
<p>Executes a command depending on a condition. After stating the condition (eg whether one number
is bigger than another, or whether two strings match) you must use THEN and follow with another
instruction. Examples:</p>

<pre>
if x = 10 then print "X is 10! Woohoo"
</pre>

<pre>
if x = y then print "X is the same as Y"
</pre>

<pre>
if x = 'm' then print "X contains the letter m"
</pre>

<pre>
if x &lt; y then print "Now X is less than Y"
</pre>

<pre>
if x &gt; y then goto xbiggerthany
</pre>

<pre>
if $1 = "quit" then end
</pre>

<pre>
if $1 = $2 then gosub stringsmatch
</pre>




<br />

<a name="input"></a>
<h3>INPUT</h3>
<p>Gets input from the user and stores the result into a numeric or string variable. Examples:</p>

<pre>
input x
input $1
</pre>




<br />

<a name="load"></a>
<h3>LOAD</h3>
<p>Loads the specified file into RAM at the specified point. The first argument is the filename,
and the second the location into which it should be loaded. If the file cannot be found or loaded,
the R variable contains 1 after the instruction; otherwise it contains 0 and the S variable
contains the file size. Examples:</p>

<pre>
load "example.txt" 40000
if r = 1 then goto fail
print "File size is:"
print s
end

fail:
print "File couldn't be loaded"
end
</pre>

<pre>
$1 = "example.txt"
x = 40000

load $1 x
if r = 1 then goto fail
print "File size is:"
print s
end

fail:
print "File couldn't be loaded"
end
</pre>




<br />

<a name="move"></a>
<h3>MOVE</h3>
<p>Moves the cursor position on the screen. Examples:</p>

<pre>
move 20 15
</pre>

<pre>
x = 20
y = 15
move x y
</pre>




<br />

<a name="next"></a>
<h3>NEXT</h3>
<p>Continues the FOR loop specified previously, and must be followed by a variable. See FOR above. Example:</p>

<pre>
next x
</pre>




<br />

<a name="pause"></a>
<h3>PAUSE</h3>
<p>Delays execution of the program by the specified 10ths of a second. This ultimately results in a BIOS
call and may be slower or faster in some PC emulators. Try it on real hardware to be sure. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "Now let's wait for three seconds..."
pause 30

print "Hey, and one more, this time with a variable..."
x = 10
pause x
</pre>




<br />

<a name="peek"></a>
<h3>PEEK</h3>
<p>Retrieve the byte stored in the specifed location in RAM. Examples:</p>

<pre>
peek a 40000
print "The number stored in memory location 40000 is..."
print a
</pre>

<pre>
x = 32768
peek a x
</pre>




<br />

<a name="poke"></a>
<h3>POKE</h3>
<p>Insert the byte (0 to 255) value into the specified location in RAM. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "Putting the number 126 into location 40000 in memory..."
poke 126 40000

print "Now doing the same, but using variables..."
x = 126
y = 40000
poke x y
</pre>





<br />

<a name="port"></a>
<h3>PORT</h3>
<p>Sends and receives bytes from the specified port. Examples:</p>

<pre>
x = 1
port out 1234 x
port out 1234 15
port in 1234 x
</pre>





<br />

<a name="print"></a>
<h3>PRINT</h3>
<p>Displays text or the contents of a variable onto the screen. This will also move the cursor onto a
new line after printing, unless the command is followed by a space and semi-colon. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "Hello, world!"

$1 = "Some text"
print $1

x = 123
print x

$2 = "Mike"
print "No newlines here, " ;
print $2
</pre>

<p>Note that for numerical variables, the PRINT command also supports two extra keywords:</p>

<pre>
x = 109
print x
print chr x
print hex x
</pre>

<p>In the first print command, the output is 109. In the second, the output is the ASCII character
for 109 -- that is, 'm'. And in the third command, it shows the hexadecimal equivalent of 109.</p>




<br />

<a name="rand"></a>
<h3>RAND</h3>
<p>Generate a random integer number between two values (inclusive) and store it
in a variable. Example:</p>

<pre>
rem *** Make X a random number between 50 and 2000 ***

rand x 50 2000
</pre>





<br />

<a name="rem"></a>
<h3>REM</h3>
<p>A remark -- ie a comment that the BASIC interpreter ignores. Example:</p>

<pre>
rem *** This routine calculates the cuteness of kittens ***
</pre>





<br />

<a name="return"></a>
<h3>RETURN</h3>
<p>Switches execution back to the position of the prior GOSUB statement. See GOSUB above for
more information. Example:</p>

<pre>
return
</pre>





<br />

<a name="save"></a>
<h3>SAVE</h3>
<p>Saves data from memory to a file on the disk. The first parameter is the filename, the second
the location in RAM where the data starts, and the third the number (in bytes) the amount of data to save. After
execution, the R variable contains 1 if the file save operation failed (eg if the file already exists or it's
a write-only medium), or 0 if it was successful. Examples:</p>

<pre>
save "myfile.txt" 40000 256
</pre>

<pre>
$1 = "myfile.txt"
x = 40000
y = 256
save $1 x y
</pre>




<br />

<a name="serial"></a>
<h3>SERIAL</h3>
<p>Turns on serial port 1, sends a byte, or receives a byte depending on the following command. There
are two modes: 1200 baud and 9600 baud. Examples:</p>

<pre>
print "Enabling the serial port at 1200 baud..."
serial on 1200
</pre>

<pre>
print "Enabling the serial port at 9600 baud..."
serial on 9600
</pre>

<pre>
print "Sending the number 20 to the serial port, then 50..."
x = 20
serial send x
serial send 50
</pre>

<pre>
print "Receiving a byte from the serial port..."
serial rec x
</pre>



<br />

<a name="sound"></a>
<h3>SOUND</h3>
<p>Generate a note from the PC speaker at the specified frequency, for the specified length of time
in 10ths of a second. Example:</p>

<pre>
print "Playing a low-middle-ish C for two seconds..."
sound 4000 20
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> some quick frequencies. 4000 = C. 3600 = D. 3200 = E. 3000 = F. 2700 = G. 2400 = A. 2100 = B.</p>



<br />




<a name="waitkey"></a>
<h3>WAITKEY</h3>
<p>Pauses program execution, awaiting a keypress, and stores the key in the specified
variable. Note some special values: 1 for the Up cursor key; 2 for Down; 3 for Left;
4 for Right; 13 for Enter; 27 for Esc.</p>

<pre>
waitkey x
if x = 'm' then print "m was pressed"
if x = 4 then print "You hit the Right cursor key"
</pre>




<br />

<h2>Samples</h2>

<a name="hexdumper"></a>
<h3>Hex dumper</h3>

<p>Asks for a filename, loads the file data into the start of empty RAM, then loops over it, printing the value
of each byte in hexadecimal format. Note that the <strong>S</strong> variable is filled with the file size
after the <strong>LOAD</strong> instruction, so we use it as a counter (counting down) to find out when
we've finished the file.</p>

<pre>
rem *** Hex dumper ***

print "Enter a filename:"
input $1

x = RAMSTART

load $1 x
if r = 1 then goto error

loop:
  peek a x
  print hex a ;
  print "  " ;
  x = x + 1
  s = s - 1
  if s = 0 then goto finish
  goto loop

<a name="fileuppercaser"></a>
<h3>File uppercaser</h3>

<p>Asks for a filename, loads the file data, converts all the lowercase characters to uppercase,
asks for a new filename, and saves the changed data to that new file. Note that the <strong>S</strong>
variable is filled with the file size after the <strong>LOAD</strong> instruction; we save that until
the <strong>SAVE</strong> operation later so that we save the correct number of bytes. However, we make
a copy of it into the <strong>C</strong> variable to use as a counter as we move through the file.</p>

<pre>
